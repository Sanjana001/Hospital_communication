Problem Statement: 
To improve the communication between hospital staff and patients.

Problems facing By the Patients: 
The following are some of the problems which sometimes make the patients helpless or angry.
1.) Forgetting their test reports at home
2.) Forget the date of appointment to the doctor.
3.) Misplace the reports/papers where doctor has prescribed the medicines.
4.) Waiting in queues in order to take the appointment of doctor.

Solution: 
To overcome these problems we have made a solution to put all these information online. Below there is a small website whose work is under developing for a particular hospital at a particular location to manage the communication of the patients of that hospital to doctors.In this website you need to make an account and after login it will ask patient about his disease or problem and accordingly make an appointment which the patient can see in his dashboard.
                     In Dashboard all the information regarding the patient will be saved and uploaded by the hospital staff. We will give the right to the authority of hospital staff for editing and uploading the information. Except hospital staff nobody can edit the information.
                     By doing so, the patients will not only  get all the information about their appointment but it(website) will also decrease the rate of spreading infections due to any virus in future.
Moreover with this solution the patients can also read the prescription/medicines prescribed by the doctors which they usually don't understand instead of chemists and other doctors.
