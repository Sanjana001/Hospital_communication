The following are some of the problems which sometimes make the patients helpless or angry.
1.) Forget the date of appointment to the doctor
2.) Waiting in queues in order to take the appointment of doctor.
3.) Go to hospital for some minor infections which can be cured by having some basic knowledge about medicines or by taking some precautions.
4.) To get all updates about hospital.

Solution: 
To overcome these problems we come to a solution to put all these information online. Below there is a small website whose work is under developing for a particular hospital at a particular location to manage the communication of the patients of that hospital to the doctors.In this website you need to make an account and after login it will ask patient about his disease or problem and accordingly make an appointment which the patient can see in his dashboard.
                     In Dashboard all the information regarding the patient will be saved or uploaded by the hospital staff. We will give the right to the authority of hospital staff for editing and uploading the information. Except hospital staff nobody can edit the information.
                     By doing so, the patients will not only  get all the information about their appointment but it(website) will also decrease the rate of spreading infections due to any virus in future.Moreover with this solution the hospital staff can also prescribed medicines to their patients if they will suffering from minor infection or fever.
